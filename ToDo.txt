2) For scenario wheel
 a) Fix styling 
 b) change wording
 c) add explanatory text
 d) ensure that screen reader function works

3) fix navbar so that it reappears when you scroll up

4) In mobile view (and maybe tablet too) you need to change the margin for the logo so that it lines up with everything below it

5) fix the horoscope generator, because the image and the resulting horoscope text both have absolute position, the collapsible doesn't 
know how high to be to fit the content, which sucks. Currently it renders to just less than half the screen width, but it seems easier
said than done to then get the text automatically to render at a size that fits inside that space

done

1) sort out sequencing of the collapsers and collapsibles, in tablet size it's
doing a hybrid of the mobile and desktop versions of the stacking 

4) in tablet mode (stack 2 on the top line, 1 on the bottom), the trio of smaller projects will need to have the sequencing of its
collapsers and collapsibles modified to go 124536, I think
