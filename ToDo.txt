1) You're going to have to automate scrolling up upon pressing any of the collapser buttons, as follows: scroll to the top of the just opened collapsible

2) For scenario wheel and raven frames landing page(?) - add explanatory text
 
3) Style footer nav to optimise across device types

4) neaten up the code. esp all the media queries, maybe some of it could be automatically in the html instead of in the css sheet, or
not, maybe it doesn't matter. But it is a hot mess.

6) Connect all the links

7) check accessibility esp all the aria references esp in accordian controls of lightboxes

8) style email link



done

1) sort out sequencing of the collapsers and collapsibles, in tablet size it's
doing a hybrid of the mobile and desktop versions of the stacking 

4) in tablet mode (stack 2 on the top line, 1 on the bottom), the trio of smaller projects will need to have the sequencing of its
collapsers and collapsibles modified to go 124536, I think

2) 
 a) Fix styling 
 b) change wording

cakes, pigs, microwaves, penguins
fly, clang, taste, saunter
fast, loudly, delicious, obligingly 

voles sashay enticingly 
penguins saunter nonchalently

voles sashay briskly
penguins saunter softly
giraffes gallop swiftly
pigs snuffle loudly

d) ensure that screen reader function works

5) fix the horoscope generator, because the image and the resulting horoscope text both have absolute position, the collapsible doesn't 
know how high to be to fit the content, which sucks. Currently it renders to just less than half the screen width, but it seems easier
said than done to then get the text automatically to render at a size that fits inside that space

9) Tammi Husband should render smaller for tablets(?) and mobiles

3) fix navbar so that it reappears when you scroll up - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_navbar_hide_scroll

4) In mobile view (and maybe tablet too) you need to change the margin for the logo so that it lines up with everything below it
