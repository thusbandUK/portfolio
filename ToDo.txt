1) tammi or tom - you need to decide, you could change it later, but you'll obvs incur costs

4) neaten up the code. esp all the media queries, maybe some of it could be automatically in the html instead of in the css sheet, or
not, maybe it doesn't matter. But it is a hot mess.

10)  ensure that privacy statement scrolls to the top and reads well in all screens. Or it could just be 
a 50% height sitch with a scroll bar, I mean who really cares about privacy?

ditched

1) For scenario wheel and raven frames landing page(?) - add explanatory text

done

9) revise privacy statement text to match this site (eg no google analytics needed, cookies will differ, email different etc)

1) insert privacy statement into collapsible

2) on really narrow screens, the skills need to stack

6) Connect all the links, incl github and linked in

9) bigger bottom margin for main projects between the specific pixel range where they bump into what's below them

1) sort out sequencing of the collapsers and collapsibles, in tablet size it's
doing a hybrid of the mobile and desktop versions of the stacking 

1) You're going to have to automate scrolling up upon pressing any of the collapser buttons, as follows: scroll to the top of the just opened collapsible

4) in tablet mode (stack 2 on the top line, 1 on the bottom), the trio of smaller projects will need to have the sequencing of its
collapsers and collapsibles modified to go 124536, I think

3) Style footer nav to optimise across device types

2) 
 a) Fix styling 
 b) change wording

cakes, pigs, microwaves, penguins
fly, clang, taste, saunter
fast, loudly, delicious, obligingly 

voles sashay enticingly 
penguins saunter nonchalently

voles sashay briskly
penguins saunter softly
giraffes gallop swiftly
pigs snuffle loudly

d) ensure that screen reader function works

5) fix the horoscope generator, because the image and the resulting horoscope text both have absolute position, the collapsible doesn't 
know how high to be to fit the content, which sucks. Currently it renders to just less than half the screen width, but it seems easier
said than done to then get the text automatically to render at a size that fits inside that space

9) Tammi Husband should render smaller for tablets(?) and mobiles

3) fix navbar so that it reappears when you scroll up - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_navbar_hide_scroll

4) In mobile view (and maybe tablet too) you need to change the margin for the logo so that it lines up with everything below it

2) Close buttons (crosses) need to be linked up for connectibles

11) Upload CV as downloadable PDF

7) check accessibility esp all the aria references esp in accordian controls of lightboxes ALSO ensure screen reader can get the horoscope

8) style email link
